        <h2 class="themes_title">Common themes I found with other students</h2>
        <div class="themes_card">
            <ul>
                <li>I noticed two major themes in regards to why other students are taking classes:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            The first theme is that students are trying to learn more about computers and new media and the 
                            improve their understanding such as <a class ="students_links" href="https://nikkiraww.wixsite.com/csce445" target = "_blank">Nikki Rad</a>, 
                            <a class ="students_links" target = "_blank" href="https://saraheilenesotelo9.wixsite.com/csce656/about-me">Sarah Soleto</a>, 
                            and <a class ="students_links" target = "_blank" href="https://saraheilenesotelo9.wixsite.com/csce656/about-me">Akhil Mathew</a>
                        </li>
                    </ul> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Another common theme I noticed regarding the course selection is that the class is required to graduate and has 
                            managable schedule. 
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>Commonalities in regards to media consumption and challenges:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            I have noticed the reccuring theme that visual media and short videos are highly addictive and time wasting. The same 
                            challenge has been discussed by <a class ="students_links" target = "_blank" href="https://saraheilenesotelo9.wixsite.com/csce656/about-me">Akhil Mathew</a>, 
                            <a class ="students_links" target = "_blank" href="https://sites.google.com/view/csce445assignment1/home">Michael Kha</a>, and 
                            <a class ="students_links" target = "_blank" href="https://julia.teleki.net/#section_6">Julia Teleki</a>.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            I have also noticed the common challenge regarding the prevalence of Ads and commercials in Television and social media. This same challenge has 
                            been shared by several students such as <a class ="students_links" target = "_blank" href="https://sites.google.com/tamu.edu/vincent-lobello-csce445/home">Vincent Lobello</a>
                            and <a class ="students_links" target = "_blank" href="https://saraheilenesotelo9.wixsite.com/csce656/about-me">Sarah Sotelo</a>.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Another common challenge I found is cross-platform and cross-device compaitibility issues. The challenge of some media contents being specificly tailored
                            to one platform and not working for others such as (spotify vs apple music) or cross-device (android vs ios) have been discussed by 
                            <a class ="students_links" target = "_blank" href="https://jiwon-kim-csce-656.notion.site/jiwon-kim-csce-656/Jiwon-Kim-b74fccb636394d7781f49e90a220864c">Jiwon Kim</a> and 
                            <a class ="students_links" target = "_blank" href="https://kirthivel.wixsite.com/kirthi-csce-445-assi">Kirthivel Ramesh</a>.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

        <div class="changes_wrapper">
            <h2 class="themes_title">Changes to my media heirarchy?</h2>
            <div class="changes_card">
                <p>After looking at other student's media consumption and hierarchy, I have found a lot of resemblance which made me comfortable with what
                    my media hierrachy looks like. One reservation I have is that I could have grouped my vidual media by the platform and streaming services I utilize. 
                    Another thing I noticed is that in my first assignments I forgot to include some major forms of media I consume. Looking at others media consumption made
                    me realize that I forgot Emails, Discord, FaceTime, Twitch and other media I usually use. In regards to challenges, I could have identified and added
                    the ads issue and cross-device and cross platform compatibility issues in my media challenges for assignment 1.
